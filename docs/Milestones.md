_# Implementation Plan and Milestones

This document provides a step-by-step implementation plan with clear milestones to guide the development of the data structure visualization web application. This plan is designed to be followed sequentially, allowing for an iterative and manageable development process.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Basic UI

**Objective**: To create the initial project structure and a basic user interface.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Initialize a new project using Vite with the React and TypeScript template.
    2.  Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
    3.  Create the main application layout, including a header, a main content area, and a footer.
    4.  Implement the input section with a `textarea` for user input and a "Visualize" button.
    5.  Create placeholder components for the main visualization display and the side information panel.

- **Outcome**: A running React application with the basic UI structure in place.

## Milestone 2: Parsing and Validation

**Objective**: To process and validate the user's input.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Install the `json5` and `zod` libraries.
    2.  Create a function that takes the raw text from the `textarea` and parses it using `JSON5.parse()`.
    3.  Define a Zod schema to validate the parsed data. For the initial version, this can be a simple schema that checks for an array.
    4.  Display the parsed data in the console to verify that it is being processed correctly.
    5.  Implement error handling to gracefully manage invalid input.

- **Outcome**: The application can take a Python-like list as input, parse it, validate it, and log the result.

## Milestone 3: Basic Visualization with CSS Grid

**Objective**: To render a simple 2D array using CSS Grid.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Create a new React component, `ArrayVisualizer`, that takes the parsed data as a prop.
    2.  Use CSS Grid to render the array as a grid of cells. Each cell should display its value.
    3.  Style the cells to make them visually distinct.

- **Outcome**: A 2D array entered by the user is visualized as a grid in the main display area.

## Milestone 4: Interactive Folding for Nested Arrays

**Objective**: To add interactivity to the visualization.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Modify the `ArrayVisualizer` component to recursively render nested arrays.
    2.  Add a button or a click handler to each nested array to allow the user to "fold" and "unfold" it.
    3.  Use React state to manage the folded/unfolded state of each nested array.

- **Outcome**: The user can interact with the visualization to explore nested data structures.

## Milestone 5: Advanced Visualization with D3.js

**Objective**: To incorporate a more powerful visualization library for complex data structures.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Install the `d3` library.
    2.  Create a new component, `TreeVisualizer`, that uses D3.js to render a tree data structure.
    3.  Learn the basics of D3's data binding and layout generators (e.g., `d3.tree`).
    4.  Implement a way for the user to select the data type (e.g., a dropdown) and render the appropriate visualizer.

- **Outcome**: The application can visualize both arrays and tree-like structures.

## Milestone 6: 3D Visualization with react-three-fiber

**Objective**: To add support for 3D data structures.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Install `three` and `@react-three/fiber`.
    2.  Create a new component, `TensorVisualizer`, that uses `react-three-fiber` to render a 3D tensor or matrix.
    3.  Add camera controls to allow the user to rotate and zoom the 3D visualization.

- **Outcome**: The application can visualize 3D data structures with interactive controls.

## Milestone 7: REPL Implementation

**Objective**: To build a simple REPL for interacting with the visualized data.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Install the `jsep` library.
    2.  Create a new REPL component with an input field and an output area.
    3.  Use `jsep` to parse the user's input from the REPL.
    4.  Implement a simple evaluator that can handle basic expressions, such as accessing array elements (e.g., `A[0]`).
    5.  Update the main visualization and side panel based on the result of the REPL expression.

- **Outcome**: The user can query and interact with the visualized data through a REPL.

## Milestone 8: Deployment

**Objective**: To make the application publicly accessible.

- **Tasks**:
    1.  Create a new repository on GitHub and push the project code.
    2.  Choose a deployment platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify).
    3.  Configure the deployment settings and deploy the application.

- **Outcome**: The web application is live on the internet and can be shared with others.

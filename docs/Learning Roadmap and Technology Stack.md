# Learning Roadmap and Technology Stack

This document outlines a structured learning path and the recommended technologies for developing the data structure visualization web application. The roadmap is designed for a beginner-friendly approach, starting with fundamental concepts and progressively introducing more advanced topics.

## 1. Recommended Technology Stack

The following technology stack is recommended for this project, prioritizing ease of learning and a modern development experience:

| Category          | Technology                               | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**      | Vite + React + TypeScript                | A modern and fast toolchain for building React applications with the benefits of static typing from TypeScript.                        |
| **Styling**       | Tailwind CSS                             | A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and consistent styling directly within your HTML.                                     |
| **Parsing**       | JSON5                                    | A library that can parse Python-like dictionary and list syntax, making it easier to handle the input from the user.                    |
| **Validation**    | Zod                                      | A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that helps ensure the data structure is in the expected format.             |
| **Visualization** | CSS Grid & SVG (initially), then D3.js, Cytoscape.js, react-three-fiber | Start with simpler technologies for basic visualizations and then incorporate more powerful libraries as your skills and the project grow. |

## 2. Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific set of skills or technologies. It is recommended to follow them in order to build a strong foundation.

### Module 1: Web Development Fundamentals

This module covers the essential building blocks of web development. A solid understanding of these concepts is crucial before moving on to more advanced topics.

- **HTML**: Learn to write semantic HTML to structure the application's user interface. Focus on elements like forms, inputs, and buttons.
- **CSS**: Master the fundamentals of CSS, including the box model, layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and responsive design principles.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Gain a strong command of modern JavaScript. Key topics include variables, data types, functions, objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await.

### Module 2: Introduction to React and TypeScript

This module introduces the core technologies for the frontend of the application.

- **React**: Learn the fundamentals of React, including JSX, components, props, state management with hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`), and handling user events.
- **TypeScript**: Understand the benefits of static typing and learn how to use TypeScript to write more robust and maintainable React components.
- **Vite**: Get comfortable with using Vite to create, run, and build the React application.

### Module 3: Styling with Tailwind CSS

This module focuses on how to style the application efficiently using a utility-first CSS framework.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Learn the core concepts of Tailwind CSS and how to apply utility classes to style your components. Explore responsive design features and how to customize the default configuration.

### Module 4: Data Parsing and Validation

This module covers the critical step of processing the user's input.

- **JSON5**: Learn how to use the JSON5 library to parse the user's input, which may resemble Python's data structures, into a JavaScript object.
- **Zod**: Discover how to create schemas with Zod to validate the parsed data, ensuring it conforms to the expected structure before attempting to visualize it.

### Module 5: Progressive Data Visualization

This module is broken into stages, starting with simple techniques and moving to more advanced libraries.

- **Initial Stage (CSS Grid & SVG)**: Begin by using CSS Grid to represent 2D structures like arrays and matrices. Use SVG for drawing simple connections or tree-like structures.
- **Intermediate Stage (D3.js)**: Dive into D3.js to create more complex and interactive visualizations, such as trees and graphs. Learn about D3's data-binding capabilities and scales.
- **Advanced Stage (react-three-fiber)**: For 3D data structures, learn how to use `react-three-fiber` and `three.js` to create interactive 3D scenes, add lighting, and allow for camera controls like zoom and rotation.
